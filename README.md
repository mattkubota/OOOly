# OOOly

https://oooly.io

A local-first web application for managing and planning your Paid Time Off (PTO). This tool helps you track your PTO balance, plan future time off, and manage accrual rates—all while keeping your data private in your browser's local storage.

## Features

OOOly helps you manage your time off with:

### Time Off Management
Our intuitive interface lets you plan your time off with confidence by tracking your current PTO balance and helping you plan future time off. You can easily handle different types of days off, including full days, half days, and holidays.

### Smart Accrual System
Set up your PTO accrual just like your workplace policy, with support for:
- Custom accrual rates
- Different pay period types (weekly, biweekly, or semi-monthly)
- Automatic balance tracking
- Future balance projections

### Privacy-First Approach
Your data stays in your browser—no server required. OOOly uses local storage to keep your PTO information private and accessible only to you.
